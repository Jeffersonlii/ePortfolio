        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
        My name is Jefferson Li, and I am currently a 1st year student at the University of Toronto Scarborough. I am pursuing a specialist in Computer Science and currently enrolled in the CMS coop program.<br><br>
            
        I am very self motivated by my curiosity, and work very well with a team as shown by my past projects. This portfolio shows some of the experiences I've gained throughout my academic career.
